## Reactive programming for web applications

This is internal script made for the thesis project based on reactive programming.

## Getting Started

This is a simple scripting tool. Download the repository and npm install the dev dependencies from package.json.

## Scripts

- npm start
- jscodeshift [file-path] -t [codmod-path]/[subAnalyzer.js / pipeAnalyzer.js] -dp -v 2 --parser flow

## How it Works

Type npm run-script <script_name> in order to run the script of your choice. First we run the npm start script and we type as input our directory of choice. Then we run the two custom-made codemods to analyze the files in order to find how many times pipe and subscriber used inside the code.

## Instructions

- Make an external src folder in which you will save your js/ts files.
- [optional] you can run [ntl] in order to see the available scripts to run
- npm start in your terminal.
- Type the directory of your choice when prompt asks for it
- Enter the type of files to parse.

## How I built the Scripting/Parsing Tool.

I worked on plain javascript ,gulp.js and node.js . For the parsing we use jscodeshift in order to develope the codemods of our choice. We use babel presets and babel cli in order to execute terminal commands within our js files
