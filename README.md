## Reactive programming for web applications
This is internal script made for the thesis project based on reactive programming.
## Getting Started
This is a simple scripting tool. Download the repository and npm install the dev dependencies from package.json.

## How it Works
Run app.js at your local terminal and change the source folder in which you have your projects to be parsed.

## Instructions
* Make an external src folder in which you will save your js/ts files.
* Change the directory in our app.js file.
* npm start in your terminal.

## How I built the Scripting/Parsing Tool.
I worked on plain javascript using for the parsing the Flow Parser.
